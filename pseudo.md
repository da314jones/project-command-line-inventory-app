index.js:

Import the necessary dependencies and helper functions from other files.
Implement the logic to handle command-line arguments and perform the appropriate action based on the provided arguments.
prod_helpers.js:

Import the necessary dependencies for file system operations.
Implement helper functions for reading and writing JSON files.
create_controller.js:

Implement the logic for creating a new item in the inventory.
destroy_controller.js:

Implement the logic for deleting an item from the inventory.
show_controller.js:

Implement the logic for displaying a list of all items in the inventory.
update_controller.js:

Implement the logic for updating an existing item in the inventory.
In terms of import and export statements, here's a general idea:

index.js:

Import dependencies and functions from other files as needed.
Export the necessary functions to be used by other modules.
prod_helpers.js:

Import the necessary dependencies for file system operations, if any.
Implement helper functions for reading and writing JSON files.
Export the helper functions to be used by other modules.
create_controller.js:

Import any dependencies or helper functions needed for creating items.
Implement the logic for creating a new item.
Export the function for creating items to be used by other modules.
destroy_controller.js:

Import any dependencies or helper functions needed for deleting items.
Implement the logic for deleting an item.
Export the function for deleting items to be used by other modules.
show_controller.js:

Import any dependencies or helper functions needed for displaying items.
Implement the logic for displaying all items.
Export the function for displaying items to be used by other modules.
update_controller.js:

Import any dependencies or helper functions needed for updating items.
Implement the logic for updating an item.
Export the function for updating items to be used by other modules.
Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and file structure. This pseudo-code provides a general guideline for organizing your files and implementing the necessary functions.
